# Multimodal-political-deception-detection
Political statements are carefully crafted to garner public support for a particular ideology. These statements are often biased and sometimes misleading. Separating
fact from fiction has proven to be a difficult task, generally accomplished by crosschecking political statements against an impartial and trustworthy news source. In
this article, we make three contributions. First, we compile a novel multimodal dataset, which consists of 180 videos with accompanying audio recordings and
transcripts, featuring 88 politicians categorized by political party. To our knowledge, this is the second multimodal deception detection dataset from real-life
data and the first in the political field. Second, we extract features from the linguistic, visual, and acoustic modalities to develop a system capable of
discriminating between truthful and deceptive political statements. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis on different multimodal features to identify the behavioral patterns used by politicians when it comes to deception.
